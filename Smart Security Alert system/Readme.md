# Smart Security Alert System

## Overview
This project is a **Smart Security Alert System** designed using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. It detects unauthorized access attempts and triggers security measures accordingly.

## **Aim**
To construct a simple and smart security alert system using Packet Tracer to detect when someone tries to open the door.

## **Software Required**
- Cisco Packet Tracer

## **Scenario**
The security system includes the following components:
- **Home Gateway**
- **Smartphone**
- **Web Camera**
- **Motion Detector**
- **Door**
- **Siren**

-----------------

### **System Functionality**
- When someone attempts to unlock the door:
  - The **web camera** and **siren** are activated.
  - If there is no motion, they remain off.
- The **door can be locked and unlocked using a smartphone**.

## **Smart Security System Setup**
### **Providing Conditions**
- **If the door is closed and motion is detected:** System remains on alert.
- **If the door is open and motion is detected:** Siren and webcam activate.

## **Conclusion**
This project successfully implements a smart security alert system in Cisco Packet Tracer. It:
- Monitors access using a web camera and motion detector.
- Alerts through a siren when unauthorized access is detected.
- Provides remote control via a smartphone.
- Enhances automation by integrating smart home features (e.g., lamp and fan control).

This system offers an **efficient, user-friendly, and scalable** security solution for smart homes.
